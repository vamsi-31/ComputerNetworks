# Appplied major Cn Techniques

Implemented CRC,CheckSUm,hamming,file sharing using Udp Protocol and also file sharing using Tcp Protocol.

For ddns used noip website service.

User Guide
This application serves as a demonstration of UDP and TCP communication with integrated error detection and correction mechanisms. Below are the key points for users:

UDP Communication
UDP communication is implemented with two error detection mechanisms: Checksum and Hamming code.
The application facilitates sending messages and files securely over UDP.
TCP Communication
TCP communication is implemented with error detection using CRC.
Similar to UDP, the application enables secure transmission of messages and files over TCP.
File Transmission
Users can transmit both messages and files securely over the network using UDP or TCP protocols.
Dynamic DNS Integration
The application integrates a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service for dynamic IP resolution, ensuring seamless communication over changing network configurations.
